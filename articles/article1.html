    <h2 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">My Admission to EPFL-ETHZ: A Look Behind the Curtain</h2> <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Published on: <span class="font-medium">July 28, 2025</span></p> <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> After weeks of research into finding the best university to achieve my career goals, I concluded that <strong>EPFL and ETH Zurich were deal-breakers</strong>. There are countless reasons why I chose these Swiss universities, but that's a story for another time. The program I was admitted to is a <strong>joint degree in Cybersecurity from EPFL and ETH Zurich</strong>, a highly selective program, as you'll find anywhere on the internet. I'll now share what I believe was my "entry ticket" to these prestigious schools.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Academics: Beyond Extraordinary Achievements</h3> <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> Let's get this out of the way: <strong>no, I don't have a list of extraordinary achievements on my resume!</strong> That said, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Federico II in Naples, Italy. As you can see on any university rankings sites, this school is situated between 1000-1500; not bad, but surely it could have been better.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> What likely made a significant difference was my <strong>grade point average: 29.9/30</strong> (but still, I have also known a lot of  people  with a lower average being admitted). I don't know if that counts, but I also graduated from high school with full marks and honors.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">My CV: Solid, Not Standout</h3> <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> My CV is solid and well-structured, but honestly, <strong>there's nothing on it that truly sets it apart</strong>, especially when compared to some of the impressive CVs I've seen. I have some <strong>working experience</strong>, though none directly in my field, having worked as <strong>entertainment staff, a waiter, and a DJ</strong>. I also participated in a few extracurricular activities, ranging from a few days to a month in duration. I also have a strong set of hard skills, having completed about a dozen online courses in Python, C++, Cybersecurity, and Web Development, among others. While I don't believe these individual certificates or activities were game-changers on their own, <strong>collectively, they likely demonstrated my determination and genuine interest</strong> in my field.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Motivational Letter: Two Weeks of Crafting</h3> <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> I dedicated <strong>about two weeks to writing my motivational letter</strong>. I began with a personal anecdote, then discussed my past achievements. After that, I focused on what specifically drew me to these universities and what I hoped to gain from their programs. Finally, I outlined my future career goals.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> As many people advised me, <strong>I consciously avoided clichés</strong> like "I am determined to go to your university" or "I have been the best of my class." A crucial hint that guided me in writing the letter (and parts of my CV) was this: <strong>"Every time you say something, also answer the question: 'And so?'"</strong> This pushed me to elaborate on the impact or significance of each point.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Reference Letters: Quality Over Fame</h3> <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> Regarding the reference letters, I want to share some insights into my choices. I only asked professors from whom I had taken courses, ensuring they had concrete experiences and observations to write about. Of course, I also considered the professor’s academic standing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"> However, I firmly believe that <strong>between a famous professor who barely knows you and a less prominent professor with whom you've genuinely connected and shared something, the second option is hands-down better</strong>. A personal, insightful letter from someone who truly understands your capabilities and character is far more impactful.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6"> I think I've covered pretty much everything I can say about my admission journey. I'm incredibly thrilled to start this experience. Hopefully, my story has motivated you to embark on your own journey, or at the very least, helped clear up some of your doubts about admission to these universities.
